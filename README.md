# Data_Visualization_Basic_Project
This is my first data visualization project , A basic project where i have done different analysis of different trends , This project was more of a practice project for my GEN AI / AI ML journey which will help me know how to play with data , Not carried much processes like Handling Missing values just a basic start towards data , More to come.
